### Title: Roadmapping

### Learning Goals:
We will learn how to create and maintain a roadmap for an open source project

### Target Audience:
new project leads on open source projects

### Delivery Format:
In person workshop

### Level:
Beginner friendly

### Time to complete:
45 mins

### What you'll need to start:
computer, your favourite browser, GitHub account, open source project on GitHub

### Before using this resource you should be familiar with:
* Editing files in GitHub
* Writing a good README

### For information on those topics, see:
* @zee-moz's README lesson

### Glossary of key terms:
* **Roadmap**: Schedule of work to be done on a project
* **Milestone**: An event or state marking a specific stage in development on the project

### Intro to material:
When you're starting on an open source project, it's important to record what your community (this might just be you at the beginning) decides to work on! A roadmap organizes the tasks that nees to be done on a project around milestones. This helps potential contributors understand the current status of your poject and where it's going next.

A roadmap can also express your vision for the project. Make sure you clearly state why you are implementing certain things to get people excited about joining.

This can be as simple as a collection of issues in your issue tracker, or a detailed timeline complete with milestones. It's up to you to choose what works best for your community! At the Mozilla Science Lab, we break our Roadmaps into three sections:

1. **Project Mission & Summary**
2. **How to Get Involved**
3. **Timeline**

You can see an example of this in the [Contributorship Badges for Science Roadmap](https://github.com/mozillascience/PaperBadger/issues/17)

### Steps to complete:

1. Write the **Project Mission & Summary**
  * Since new contributors may be linked directly to the Roadmap, it can be jarring if you jump right into the timeline. Use this section to orient new visitors
  * Start with the project name along with your mission statement or a clear summary of what you are doing.
  * Keep this shorter than your README, but make sure your mission is clear
  * **tips**
    * Keep it short and simple!
    * Use this space to case some vision -- people get involved because they're excited about what you're building
2. Write **How to Get Involved**
  * Once users have seen your summary, they may want to get involved right away! If you have any good first bugs, or if you've labelled any of your issues with specific skillsets, link them here! This gives potential contributors a way to get involved immediately.
  * **tips**
    * Try to keep a handful of smaller, simpler tasks open labelled 'Good first bug' and make it point to let others know new contributors will be mentored through this issue
    * Try labelling tasks by type of contribution (development, design, discussion) - this helps limit the choices to tasks users are interested in
3. Write the **Timeline**
  * This section organizes tasks needed to complete your project around milestones
  * When your community decides to do something, write it down in the roadmap! Your roadmap will constantly be changing as you hit milestones and decide on important features.
  * **Pick some milestones** - they can be:
    * project status goals (project up on Collaborate, MVP)
    * dates (good if you have deadlines / set time to work on the project)
    * events (Mozilla Science Lab Global Sprint, MozFest)
    * short term, medium term and long term - use this if you don't have set deadlines
  * **Lists tasks under each milestone**. Take time here to explain *why* you are doing this task. It can help enforce your vision for this project.
    * Your tasks will probably be more detailed in shorter-term goals
