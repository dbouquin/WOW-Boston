**Title:** A Collaborative Workflow for Open Projects in GitHub

**Learning Goals:**
Get comfortable with a Collaborative workflow in the GitHub interface. Practice adding resources to your repo, working with issues and lables, forking and branching, writing commit messages, making and reviewing pull requests, and merging changes. You'll also practice good communication with contributors. 

**Target Audience** Project Leads and Contributors

**Delivery Format:** In-person, facilitated workshop with pairs of learners working together on each other's repositories. 

**Level:** Intermediate

**Time to complete:** 45 mins

**What you'll need to start:** two people with projects already hosted on GitHub, computers to work on, an Internet connection to access the GitHub site

Before using this resource you should be familiar with: the basics of version control, setting up a GitHub repo, markdown basics.

**For information on those topics, see:** Short Presentation: [GitHub for Collaboration and Enjoyment](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17R2EqTq7GM4RyvdG7bNK_g77r50X5-dufzgc5tBmihs/edit?usp=sharing)

**Glossary of key terms:**
repository or repo: a collection of documents where you are working and saving your work

markdown: a lightweight way of annotating a document with instructions that tell a web browser how to format and display text

version control: a way of tracking changes to a document or collection of documents. Version control is like a time machine, it can take you back to the moment your document was created, or any other point in time when you or a collaborator saved that document.

Git : the command-line software that tracks all changes to a collection of documents

GitHub: a service that hosts your repository online and helps you work with contributors. GitHub adds a web-based interface to version control. 

fork: a copy of a repository that is saved in another user's GitHub account 

branch:  a copy of a repo that is contained within the orignal repo. branches are used to work on a project features without altering the original or "master" repo.

commit: a saved change to a document in a repository

issue: a message on gitHub that outlines a task that needs to be completed

pull request: a request to add a commit or collection of commits to a repository. 

merge: the act of incorporating new changes into a repository

**Intro to material:**
The magic of GitHub is providing a structure and space for communicating about those changes, making decisions, assigning tasks. With some good set-up, you can making your project accessible and transparent, and create a respectful and productive working environment for your collaborators. 

This exercise walks you through a workflow for collaboration on open projects and demonstrates good communication with contributors. 

*Before you start, provide your partner with a link to your repository.*

1. As project lead: add any new files you've created to your repo (readme.md, roadmap.md, contributing.md). Give the file a name, and the .md extension so you can use markdown for formatting. Add your content and click commit at the bottom. 

2. As project lead. Make a new label. Where to do this: click the "Issues" tab, then look for the labels tab, just to the right of the "filter" box. Add a label called "good first bugs" 

3. As project lead: create an issue in your own repo to document a "good first bug". A good first bug is something simple that a new contributor can work on, to give contribution and this way of working a try. It's work that's useful to the project but relatively easy, not so difficult as to be overwhelming or discouraging for someone new to your project. A good first bug is as much an opportunity to learn the workflow as it is to make changes to the project.  An example of a good first bug for this exercise: fix a typo in the readme, add a badge, add a science fox, etc.

4. As contributor: Go to your partner's repo, and comment on the new "Good First Bug" issue that they've posted... introduce yourself and volunteer to work on this issue! In your own repo, go to the issue that's just been commented on. 

5. As project lead: Reply to your new contributor and assign this issue to yourself (you should act as a mentor, and offer to anser any questions). Assinging issues is a good way to track which tasks are underway and have help. 

6. As contributor: Go to your partner's repo and fork it. Then create a branch in your forked copy. Name this branch.

7. As contributor: Make a change in this branch, and commit it. Write a great commit message! The top line should summarize your changes. Include details in the field below.

8. As contributor: Make a pull request to the orginal (upstream) repo.

9. As Project Lead: Review the pull request and leave a comment thanking the contributor... Make use of gifs and emoticons here, to emphasize your appreciation!

10. As project lead:  merge the changes

11. As project lead: close the issue with thanks, gifs, and emojis!
